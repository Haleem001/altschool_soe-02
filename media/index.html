        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I am a graduate of Computer Science from the prestigious Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University.</p>
        <p>I started my tech journey in 2020 where I joined private company as a Frontend Developer intern and got introduced to HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
        <p>After that I went on to learn Python Programming Language in 2021.</p>
        <p>In 2022, I did my SIWES at IT department of NDIC where I started using the languages I learnt to build.</p>
        <p> I built a Risk Management System using Django and ReactJS, this gave me a better understanding of both Frontend and Backend development</p>
